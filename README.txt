Description of files:

[ALL of the python files were written by me]
***FeatureCreation***
kparser.py		- Parses csv data and serializes these objects
kickoff.py		- Given names of teams, interfaces with other files and builds the testing and training dataset using euclidean distances etc
featurefns.py	- Contains all code for extraction of features from parsed csv data
stadia.py		- Holds a variable which maps club name to their lat long coordinates
evalresults.py	- Evaluates the resultdata.csv files generated by kickoff.py

***AdaBoost***
kcross.py		- Interfaces with other parts of adaboost code to train and predict given test and training sets
tree.py			- Meat of AdaBoost code lives here. Code to find best splits, make predictions etc.
node.py			- Node class definition
utils.py		- Contains numerous utility functions used by AdaBoost

***Dataset***
footballdata	- Folder containing the csv data to be parsed, downloaded from: football-data.co.uk/data.php
'- epl			- Folder containing files that are parsed by kparser.py
	'- tmp		- Holds files that are staged and not being parsed

Steps to run the code:
Simply run >> python kickoff.py
This makes predictions for all matches of teams in variable teamA against variable teamB
teamA - Line 106 kickoff.py
teamB - Line 107 kickoff.py
You can change these variables and add or remove or edit items in the list
For a suggestion of teams to select view stadia.py and use team names from there.
Results are printed and also writted to resultdata.csv
You can examine the testing datasets and training datasets generated by checking out testdata.csv and traindata.csv resepectively
